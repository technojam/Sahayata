# Sahayata

Sahayata Online and Offline Disaster Management System with motive to help government and people during Natural Calamities and Disasters.

## Summary
According to the statistics, 68% of India's land is prone to drought, 60% to earthquakes, 12% to floods and 8% to cyclones, making India one of the most disaster prone countries
in the world, affecting overall 85% of Indian land and more than 50 million people. We present an approach which comes effective in evacuating masses to safe locations and also
providing a common platform for volunteers to reach out to the affected people, for government to monitor the entire state, organizing people in shelter and their basic needs.
Using interactive videos and simple step by step advice through SMS and push notification we empower user on how to react in such situations. During disaster the main issue is
internet connectivity so we have also provided these entire features mentioned above in offline mode as well.
